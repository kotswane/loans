                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The NCA brought about remedies for consumers who are experiencing stressful financial times. Consumers who are over-indebted can approach a debt counsellor and apply for debt review.</p>

                    <p>This effectively means that your debt obligations under credit agreements are managed and administered by the debt counsellor who negotiates with your creditors on your behalf and makes monthly distributions to your creditors to ensure that they do not start suing you for the debt you owe.</p>

                    <p>Administration is the same type of remedy, but also includes other types of debt and is limited to R50 000 only. When you are under administration or under debt review you are prohibited by law to incur any further debt.</p>
